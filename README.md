# Skin Cancer Classification

## Overview

This project is a deep learning-based skin cancer classification model that identifies different types of skin cancer from medical images. The model leverages convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to assist dermatologists and medical professionals in early diagnosis.

## Features

- **Classifies different types of skin cancer** from images
- **Uses deep learning (CNNs) for high accuracy**
- **Trained with PyTorch and Fastai**
- **Supports real-world medical image classification**

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset containing images of various skin cancer types with labeled categories. The dataset includes:

- Multiple types of skin lesions
- High-resolution medical images
- Labeled annotations for classification

## Model Details

- **Architecture:** CNN-based model (possibly ResNet, EfficientNet, or a custom model)
- **Framework:** PyTorch & Fastai
- **Loss Function:** Cross-entropy for classification
- **Optimizer:** Adam / SGD
- **Training:** Trained on labeled skin lesion images

## Installation

To run this project, clone the repository and install the dependencies:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/narasimha07-here/skin-cancer.git
cd skin-cancer-classification

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the Jupyter Notebook to test the model with an image:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

Load the notebook `skincancer.ipynb` and follow the instructions to classify a skin lesion image.

## Example Prediction

```python
from model import predict_skin_cancer

image_path = "test_skin_image.jpg"
classification = predict_skin_cancer(image_path)
print(f"Predicted Skin Cancer Type: {classification}")
```

## Results

- The model achieves high accuracy on test data.
- Successfully classifies different skin lesion types.
- Aims to assist in early diagnosis of skin cancer.
